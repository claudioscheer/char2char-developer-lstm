## About

The idea of this project was, given a source code, to generate new source codes following the same structure as the dataset. For that, I used a character-to-character architecture powered by an LSTM.


## Disclaimer

The network was tested on a small dataset and may overfit. A sample of the dataset is available [here](dataset/source-code.txt).


## To do

- [ ] Explain the source code in detail.
- [ ] Add a Jupyter Notebook.
